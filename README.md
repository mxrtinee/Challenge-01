# Challenge-01 HTML CSS Refactoring
This challenge is a web agency's marketing website that has been enhanced to follow accessibility standards and best practices for search engine optimization (SEO). 

The task was to refactor the webpage by checking that all links are functioning correctly, increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
